# Flutter Layout Structures Demo

**Experiment 2B: Implementation of Different Layout Structures**  
**Project:** Flutter Layout Widgets Demonstration

## 📋 Project Overview

This Flutter application demonstrates the implementation of three fundamental layout widgets in Flutter:
- **Row Widget** - Horizontal layout arrangement
- **Column Widget** - Vertical layout arrangement  
- **Stack Widget** - Layered/overlapping layout arrangement

## 🎯 Experiment Objectives

- Understand and implement Row layout for horizontal widget arrangement
- Learn Column layout for vertical widget arrangement
- Explore Stack layout for overlapping/layered widget positioning
- Compare different layout behaviors and use cases
- Practice Flutter widget composition and navigation

## 🏗️ Project Structure

```
lib/
├── main.dart              # Main application with all layout demos
```

## 🚀 Features

### 1. **Main Navigation Screen**
- Central hub with buttons to navigate to different layout demos
- Clean and intuitive user interface
- Easy access to all three layout examples

### 2. **Row Layout Demo**
- Demonstrates horizontal arrangement of widgets
- Uses `MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly` for equal spacing
- Shows three colored containers (Red, Green, Blue) arranged horizontally
- Perfect for creating toolbars, navigation bars, or horizontal button groups

### 3. **Column Layout Demo**
- Demonstrates vertical arrangement of widgets
- Uses `MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly` for equal vertical spacing
- Shows three colored containers (Red, Green, Blue) arranged vertically
- Ideal for forms, lists, or vertical menu layouts

### 4. **Stack Layout Demo**
- Demonstrates overlapping/layered arrangement of widgets
- Uses `Alignment.center` to center all widgets
- Shows three containers of decreasing sizes stacked on top of each other
- Perfect for creating overlays, badges, or complex UI compositions

## 🎨 Layout Widget Details

### Row Widget
```dart
Row(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
  children: <Widget>[
    // Horizontal arrangement of widgets
  ],
)
```
- **Main Axis:** Horizontal (left to right)
- **Cross Axis:** Vertical (top to bottom)
- **Use Cases:** Navigation bars, button groups, horizontal lists

### Column Widget
```dart
Column(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
  children: <Widget>[
    // Vertical arrangement of widgets
  ],
)
```
- **Main Axis:** Vertical (top to bottom)
- **Cross Axis:** Horizontal (left to right)
- **Use Cases:** Forms, vertical lists, menu layouts

### Stack Widget
```dart
Stack(
  alignment: Alignment.center,
  children: <Widget>[
    // Overlapping widgets (first widget at bottom)
  ],
)
```
- **Positioning:** Widgets stack on top of each other
- **Z-Order:** Later widgets appear on top
- **Use Cases:** Overlays, badges, complex compositions

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Key Components:
1. **LayoutDemoHome** - Main navigation screen
2. **RowLayoutDemo** - Row layout demonstration
3. **ColumnLayoutDemo** - Column layout demonstration  
4. **StackLayoutDemo** - Stack layout demonstration

### Navigation:
- Uses `Navigator.push()` for screen transitions
- Material Design navigation patterns
- Back button functionality included

## 📱 How to Run

1. **Prerequisites:**
   ```bash
   flutter doctor
   ```

2. **Clone and Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd flutter_2b
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

4. **Platform Options:**
   - Android: `flutter run -d android`
   - iOS: `flutter run -d ios`
   - Web: `flutter run -d chrome`
   - Windows: `flutter run -d windows`

## 🎮 User Interaction Flow

1. **Launch App** → Main screen with three demo buttons
2. **Select Layout** → Choose Row, Column, or Stack demo
3. **View Demo** → See colored containers arranged according to layout
4. **Navigate Back** → Return to main screen using back button
5. **Try Other Layouts** → Explore different layout behaviors

## 📊 Layout Comparison

| Layout | Direction | Spacing | Best For |
|--------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Row | Horizontal | Even distribution | Toolbars, Navigation |
| Column | Vertical | Even distribution | Forms, Lists |
| Stack | Overlapping | Centered alignment | Overlays, Badges |

## 🔍 Learning Outcomes

After completing this experiment, you will understand:

- ✅ How to implement horizontal layouts using Row widget
- ✅ How to implement vertical layouts using Column widget
- ✅ How to create overlapping layouts using Stack widget
- ✅ MainAxis and CrossAxis concepts in Flutter layouts
- ✅ Different alignment and spacing options
- ✅ When to use each layout widget effectively
- ✅ Flutter navigation between screens
- ✅ Widget composition and reusability

## 🎨 Color Scheme

- **Red Container:** `Colors.red` - Primary visual element
- **Green Container:** `Colors.green` - Secondary visual element
- **Blue Container:** `Colors.blue` - Tertiary visual element
- **App Bars:** Different colors for each demo (Red, Green, Purple)

## 🔧 Customization Options

You can modify the following aspects:
- Container colors and sizes
- Spacing and alignment properties
- Add more containers or different widgets
- Implement different MainAxisAlignment options
- Add animations or transitions
