# Flutter Named Routes Navigation Demo

**Project by: Pooja**  
**Experiment: Navigation with Named Routes Implementation**

## 📱 Project Overview

This Flutter application demonstrates the implementation of **Named Routes Navigation**, a powerful routing system that allows for organized and maintainable navigation between different screens in a Flutter app. The project showcases how to set up a multi-screen application with clean navigation patterns.

## 🎯 Experiment Purpose

The primary goal of this experiment is to understand and implement:
- Named route configuration in Flutter
- Navigation between multiple screens using route names
- Proper navigation stack management
- Clean architecture for multi-screen applications

## 🏗️ Application Structure

The application consists of **three main screens**:

1. **Home Screen** (`/`) - Entry point of the application
2. **Second Screen** (`/second`) - Intermediate navigation screen
3. **Third Screen** (`/third`) - Final destination with return navigation

## 🔧 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Named Routes Configuration
```dart
routes: {
  '/': (context) => HomeScreen(),
  '/second': (context) => SecondScreen(),
  '/third': (context) => ThirdScreen(),
}
```

### 2. Navigation Methods Used
- **`Navigator.pushNamed()`** - Navigate to a new screen using route names
- **`Navigator.popUntil()`** - Return to a specific route in the navigation stack

### 3. Screen Flow
```
Home Screen → Second Screen → Third Screen
     ↑                              ↓
     ←────────────────────────────────
          (Direct return to home)
```

## 📱 Screen Details

### Home Screen
- **Route**: `/`
- **Function**: Starting point of the application
- **Action**: Contains a button to navigate to the Second Screen
- **Navigation**: Uses `Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/second')`

### Second Screen
- **Route**: `/second`
- **Function**: Intermediate screen in the navigation flow
- **Action**: Contains a button to navigate to the Third Screen
- **Navigation**: Uses `Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/third')`

### Third Screen
- **Route**: `/third`
- **Function**: Final destination screen
- **Action**: Contains a button to return directly to the Home Screen
- **Navigation**: Uses `Navigator.popUntil(context, ModalRoute.withName('/'))` to clear the navigation stack and return to home

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure Flutter SDK is installed on your system
2. **Clone/Download**: Get the project files
3. **Navigate**: Open terminal in the project directory
4. **Install Dependencies**: Run `flutter pub get`
5. **Run Application**: Execute `flutter run`

## 💻 Code Architecture

### Main App Configuration
- **Entry Point**: `main()` function that runs `MyApp()`
- **App Setup**: `MaterialApp` with named routes configuration
- **Initial Route**: Set to `/` (Home Screen)

### Screen Components
- All screens extend `StatelessWidget` for simplicity
- Each screen has a consistent structure with `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, and `Body`
- Navigation buttons are implemented using `ElevatedButton`

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

Through this experiment, you will learn:

1. **Route Management**: How to organize routes using named routes instead of direct widget navigation
2. **Navigation Patterns**: Different ways to navigate between screens (push, pop, popUntil)
3. **Stack Management**: Understanding how Flutter manages the navigation stack
4. **Code Organization**: Clean separation of screens and navigation logic
5. **User Experience**: Creating intuitive navigation flows

## 🔍 Key Concepts Demonstrated

### Named Routes vs Anonymous Routes
- **Named Routes**: Predefined route names for better organization
- **Benefits**: Easier maintenance, centralized route management, better readability

### Navigation Stack Management
- **Push Navigation**: Adding screens to the navigation stack
- **Pop Navigation**: Removing screens from the stack
- **PopUntil**: Removing multiple screens until reaching a specific route

### MaterialApp Configuration
- **initialRoute**: Defines the starting screen
- **routes**: Map of route names to widget builders

## 🛠️ Technical Specifications

- **Framework**: Flutter
- **Language**: Dart
- **Architecture**: Single file implementation with multiple widgets
- **Navigation**: Named routes with MaterialApp
- **UI Components**: Material Design components (Scaffold, AppBar, ElevatedButton)

## 📚 Further Enhancements

This basic implementation can be extended with:
- Route arguments passing
- Custom route transitions
- Route guards and authentication
- Dynamic route generation
- Nested navigation
- Bottom navigation integration
