# Flutter Lab Session 2: Widget Exploration Project

**Created by:** Pooja  
**Date:** July 30, 2025  
**Lab Session:** 2 - Exploring Various Flutter Widgets

## 📋 Project Overview

This Flutter project serves as a practical demonstration and exploration of various Flutter widgets as part of Lab Session 2. The application showcases fundamental Flutter concepts including state management, widget composition, and Material Design principles through a simple counter application.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

The primary goal of this lab session is to explore and understand various Flutter widgets categorized by their functionalities:

### Widget Categories Covered:

#### 🏗️ Layout Widgets
- **Scaffold**: Implements the basic Material Design layout structure
- **Column**: Arranges widgets vertically 
- **Center**: Centers child widgets within the parent
- **Container** (concept): Versatile widget for alignment, padding, margin, and decoration

#### 📝 Text and Styling Widgets
- **Text**: Displays styled text with various formatting options
- **TextStyle**: Applied through theme for consistent text styling

#### 🔘 Interactive Widgets
- **FloatingActionButton**: Material Design floating action button
- **IconButton** (via FloatingActionButton): Button with icon functionality
- **GestureDetector** (implicit): Handles user interactions

#### 🎨 Material Design Widgets
- **AppBar**: Material Design app bar with title and theming
- **MaterialApp**: Root widget that provides Material Design styling
- **ThemeData**: Defines the overall visual theme of the application

#### 📱 Core Flutter Concepts
- **StatefulWidget**: Manages changing state (counter value)
- **StatelessWidget**: Immutable widgets (app root)
- **State Management**: Using `setState()` for reactive UI updates

## 🏃‍♀️ Application Functionality

### Core Features:
1. **Counter Display**: Shows the current count value
2. **Increment Action**: Floating action button to increase counter
3. **State Persistence**: Counter maintains state during hot reload
4. **Material Design**: Follows Google's Material Design guidelines
5. **Responsive UI**: Automatically rebuilds when state changes

### Widget Hierarchy:
```
MyApp (StatelessWidget)
└── MaterialApp
    └── MyHomePage (StatefulWidget)
        └── Scaffold
            ├── AppBar
            │   └── Text (title)
            ├── Body
            │   └── Center
            │       └── Column
            │           ├── Text (description)
            │           └── Text (counter value)
            └── FloatingActionButton
                └── Icon (add)
```

└── README.md             # This documentation file
```

## 🔧 Key Code Components

### 1. StatefulWidget Implementation
```dart
class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  // Demonstrates stateful widget lifecycle and state management
}
```

### 2. State Management
```dart
void _incrementCounter() {
  setState(() {
    _counter++;  // Triggers UI rebuild
  });
}
```

### 3. Material Design Theming
```dart
theme: ThemeData(
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple),
),
```

### 4. Widget Composition
```dart
Scaffold(
  appBar: AppBar(...),
  body: Center(
    child: Column(...),
  ),
  floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(...),
)
```

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites:
- Flutter SDK installed
- VS Code or Android Studio
- Chrome browser (for web development)
- Android Studio (for Android development)
- Xcode (for iOS development on macOS)

### Running the Application:
```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on available device
flutter run

# Run on specific platforms
flutter run -d chrome          # Web
flutter run -d windows         # Windows Desktop
flutter run -d android         # Android (requires setup)
flutter run -d ios             # iOS (requires macOS and Xcode)
```

### Development Commands:
```bash
# Hot reload (r)
# Hot restart (R)
# Quit (q)

# Check Flutter installation
flutter doctor

# Analyze code
flutter analyze

# Run tests
flutter test
```

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

By studying and running this project, you will understand:

1. **Widget Fundamentals**: How Flutter widgets work as building blocks
2. **State Management**: Difference between StatefulWidget and StatelessWidget
3. **Material Design**: Implementation of Google's design system
4. **Layout System**: How Flutter's constraint-based layout works
5. **Hot Reload**: Flutter's fast development cycle
6. **Cross-Platform**: Single codebase running on multiple platforms

## 🔍 Widget Analysis

### Widgets Demonstrated:
| Widget | Type | Purpose | Properties Used |
|--------|------|---------|----------------|
