# Flutter Responsive UI Demo with Bird Image - Lab Session 3

**Experiment:** Lab Session 3 - Responsive UI Design with Beautiful Bird Imagery

## 📱 Project Overview

This Flutter application demonstrates responsive UI design that adapts to different screen sizes while featuring a beautiful bird image. The app automatically switches between different layouts based on the screen width, providing an optimal user experience across various devices including mobile phones, tablets, and desktop screens. The application now includes a stunning bird image that enhances the visual appeal of both layout configurations.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understanding responsive design principles in Flutter
- Implementing adaptive layouts using `LayoutBuilder`
- Creating different UI configurations for narrow and wide screens
- Learning how to handle screen size constraints dynamically

## 🏗️ Architecture & Components

### Main Components

1. **MyApp**: Root application widget that sets up the MaterialApp
2. **ResponsiveHomePage**: Main page implementing responsive behavior
3. **Layout Methods**:
   - `_buildNarrowLayout()`: Optimized for mobile/narrow screens
   - `_buildWideLayout()`: Optimized for tablet/desktop screens

### Key Responsive Features

- **Breakpoint**: 600px width threshold
- **Narrow Layout (< 600px)**: Vertical column arrangement with bird image on top
- **Wide Layout (≥ 600px)**: Horizontal row arrangement with bird image on left
- **Consistent Elements**: Beautiful bird image, Flutter logo, descriptive text, and interactive buttons
- **Enhanced Styling**: Rounded corners, shadows, and improved typography
- **Asset Management**: Proper image asset integration from local directory

## 📐 Layout Specifications

### Narrow Layout (Mobile View)

│               [Like] [Share]      │
│                                   │
└───────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- **Flutter Framework**: Cross-platform UI toolkit
- **LayoutBuilder**: Widget for responsive layout decisions
- **BoxConstraints**: Screen dimension information
- **Material Design**: UI design language

### Responsive Logic
```dart
LayoutBuilder(
  builder: (BuildContext context, BoxConstraints constraints) {
    if (constraints.maxWidth < 600) {
      return _buildNarrowLayout();  // Mobile layout
    } else {
      return _buildWideLayout();    // Desktop/Tablet layout
    }
  },
)
```

## 🎨 UI Elements

### Common Elements
- **AppBar**: Consistent header with title "Responsive UI with Bird Demo"
- **Bird Image**: Beautiful nature photograph with rounded corners and shadow effects
- **Flutter Logo**: Reduced size to complement the bird image
- **Text Widgets**: Multiple text elements with hierarchy (title, subtitle, description)
- **Interactive Buttons**: 
  - Mobile: Single "Like Bird" button with heart icon
  - Desktop: "Like Bird" and "Share" buttons with icons
- **Spacing**: Carefully calculated SizedBox widgets for optimal visual balance

### Styling
- **Theme**: Material Blue color scheme
- **Typography**: Multiple font sizes (28px, 24px, 18px, 16px, 14px) for visual hierarchy
- **Layout**: Center alignment with proper spacing
- **Images**: Rounded corners (15px mobile, 20px desktop) with subtle shadows
- **Buttons**: Enhanced with icons and proper padding

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
- Dart SDK
- IDE (VS Code, Android Studio, or IntelliJ)
- Device emulator or physical device

### Installation & Running
